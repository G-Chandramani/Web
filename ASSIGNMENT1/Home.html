        Sport pertains to any form of physical activity or game, often competitive and organized, that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.
        Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. 
        Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. </p>

    <h2>Types of Sports</h2>
    
        There are many types of sports. Some of them are as :<br>

    <p >
        Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports.
        The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi,and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.
        Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. 
        Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 
        It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.</p>

    <h2 id="hock">Hockey</h2>
    <img src="/Images/hockey.jpg" alt="Hockey image" width="200px" height="100px">
    <p>Field hockey, a dynamic and fast-paced team sport, has a rich history with origins dating back centuries. The modern form of field hockey, as we recognize it today, emerged in the 19th century, primarily in England. The game is played on a rectangular field, 100 yards long and 60 yards wide, marked with specific zones such as the goal area and shooting circle.

        Two teams, each comprising eleven players, including a goalkeeper, compete to score goals using a small, hard plastic ball and hockey sticks. These sticks, featuring a flat side and a rounded side, serve as the primary tools for ball control and striking. Players wear protective gear, including mouthguards and shin guards, with additional equipment for goalkeepers.
        
        The game begins with a face-off at the center of the field, and players employ various techniques such as passing and dribbling to advance towards the opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game or a specified period emerges victorious.
        
        Rules and fouls are integral components of field hockey, resulting in free hits, penalty corners, or penalty strokes, depending on the nature and location of the infringement. Penalty corners offer the attacking team a strategic play within the shooting circle, while penalty strokes provide a one-on-one opportunity for a player to score.
        
        Internationally, field hockey is showcased in prestigious tournaments like the Hockey World Cup and the Olympic Games, featuring powerhouse nations such as the Netherlands, Australia, Germany, and India. The sport's popularity extends globally, captivating audiences in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America.
        
        In addition to outdoor field hockey, there is an indoor variant played in enclosed spaces with slightly modified rules, leading to a faster-paced game. The International Hockey Federation (FIH) serves as the sport's global governing body, overseeing development, rules, and international competitions.
        
        Field hockey stands out for its combination of skill, teamwork, and strategic play. As a sport deeply embedded in various cultures, it continues to enthral audiences worldwide through its exciting gameplay and the spectacle of international competitions.</p>
